# Planning-First Workflow

## 1. Create / update a planning file

* Path: `scratch/<short-task-name>.md` (Derive `<short-task-name>` from the feature/bug branch name or a concise task label.)
* If the file already exists, open it instead of creating a new one.

## 2. Write an initial plan before touching code

Inside the planning file add these sections in order:

1. Summary - one-sentence description of the goal.
2. Checklist - an ordered list of concrete implementation steps. Start each line with an unchecked box `- [ ]`.
3. Context - links, code snippets, or notes that will be helpful while executing the plan.

Do not modify any source files until this plan is present.

## 3. Execute while keeping the plan up-to-date

* After completing a step, mark it `- [x]` and append a brief note of what was done (or discovered).
* If new work emerges, append additional checklist items **above** the completed section to keep ordering clear.
* Add extra context whenever it clarifies decisions or findings.

## 4. Finish up

* When every box is ticked, add a **Done** section summarizing testing/validation and linking to relevant commits/PRs.
* Leave the file for posterity; do not delete it.
